### Self-Supervised Deep Clustering for Tabular Data

Nine datasets of tabular data:
- Synthetic data
- Zelnik
- MNIST
- Pendigits
- Optdigits
- USPS
- Wine
- Mobile
- Iris

Each of the dataset trained with three self-supervised learning frameworks:
- SimCLR
- SimSiam
- Barlow Twins

Several data augmentation methods applied:
- MixUp
- MixCut
- DropOut
- Masking
- Upsampling (SMOTE)

Extra experiment:
- SimCLR framework + Transformer as backbone + Masking
