### Self-Supervised Deep Clustering for Tabular Data

Four datasets of tabular data:
- Synthetic data
- MNIST
- Pendigts
- Wine

Each of the dataset trained with three self-supervised learning frameworks:
- SimCLR
- SimSiam
- Barlow Twins

Several data augmentation methods applied:
- MixUp
- MixCut
- DropOut
- Masking
- Upsampling (SMOTE)
